# NODELESS ðŸ“·ðŸ“¡ðŸ’­ðŸ’¾
Nodeless is a application that manipulates and optimizse images that have been uploaded to Amazon S3 using AWS Lambda. 
This is my first serverless application and it was build as a practice project while I was attending the AWS Lambda Foundations course from AWS Skill Builder.
As its name implies, this app was build using Node.JS, Serverless Framework (all-in-one development & monitoring of auto-scaling apps on AWS Lambda) and sharp third party module for converting large images in common formats to smaller and web-friendly ones.
A whole lecture about this program can be found in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiP45rEOEbA) from the channel Rocketseat.
